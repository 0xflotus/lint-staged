exports[`resolveTaskFn should fail with a helpful error message if the paths to lint exceeds the limit 1`] = `
"âœ– \\"mock-fail-linter\\" found some errors. Please fix them and try committing again.
The file pattern specified for mock-fail-linter matched 3 files.
Attempting to run commands with too many arguments can result in cryptic
errors on some platforms due to limitations on the total length of the command.
Therefore, lint-staged will fail the task preemptively.

It is recommended to run the linter on the entire project and commit the changes
with --no-verify to bypass the pre-commit hook:

\`git commit -m \\"Commit message\\" --no-verify\`

Alternatively, the limit can be increased by specifying \`maxPathsToLint\`
in the lint-staged config. See https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#options.
Number of matched files exceeds limit(2)."
